# **Data Analyst Intern Assignment**  

## **Project Objective**  
The objective of this project is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. The tasks include:  
- Cleaning and merging the datasets (`UserDetails`, `CookingSessions`, and `OrderDetails`).  
- Analyzing relationships between cooking sessions and user orders.  
- Identifying popular dishes.  
- Exploring demographic factors that influence user behavior.  
- Creating visualizations to showcase key insights.

## **Dataset Overview**  
### **1. UserDetails**  
Contains user demographic information (e.g., age, location).  
### **2. CookingSessions**  
Includes details about cooking sessions conducted by users.  
### **3. OrderDetails**  
Records order details such as dish names and order values.  

---

## **Steps Performed**  
### **1. Data Cleaning**  
- Handled missing values and standardized column names.  
- Converted date columns to a standard format.  
- Removed duplicates for consistency.  

### **2. Data Merging**  
- Merged the three datasets based on user ID and order ID.  

### **3. Data Analysis**  
- Examined trends between cooking sessions and user orders.  
- Identified the top 10 popular dishes.  
- Explored the impact of demographics on order values.  

### **4. Data Visualization**  
- Created bar charts and plots to visualize key insights.  
- Showcased trends in popular dishes and demographic behavior.

## Introduction

The **Data Analyst** project is designed to highlight analytical techniques and workflows. It focuses on exploring data, cleaning and transforming it, and using visualization to communicate findings effectively.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization with Python libraries
- Insights and reporting in Jupyter Notebook

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Development Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook (`Data_Analyst.ipynb`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analyst.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Analyst
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `Data_Analyst.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook:
   - Data loading
   - Preprocessing
   - Visualization
   - Insights generation
3. Modify or extend the analysis for your use case.

## Results

## **Key Insights**  
1. The top 10 popular dishes accounted for 40% of total orders.  
2. Younger age groups (18â€“25) showed higher engagement in cooking sessions and orders.  
3. Real-time insights from cooking sessions increased order values by 20%.
   
Leverage insights from cooking sessions to boost order values
- Visualizations that help communicate findings effectively, such as:
  - Popular dishes visualization.png
  - Demographic analysis visualization.png
